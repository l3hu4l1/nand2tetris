# compiler (ii)
The code generator manages a symbol table, representing and generating code for variables, objects, and arrays. It also translates control flow commands via post-order traversal of the parse tree.

These kinds of identifiers may appear in the table:
|Identifier| Scope |
| :---: | :---: |
| Static | class |
| Field | class |
| Argument | subroutine |
| Var | subroutine |
